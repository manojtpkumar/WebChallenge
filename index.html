<p><i>Lorem Ipsum <del>is simply dummy text of the printing</del> and typesetting industry</i>.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since <br>the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled <br>it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,<br> but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <br>Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software<br> like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
